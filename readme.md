# Applied Data Analytics

Repository for the training program focused on Transitions in Education and Workforce.

### Projects
This program is centered around a core data analytics project. Teams will scope a project and can elect to answer one of the following questions:
- What are the earnings and employment outcomes of various credentials and degrees, remedial skills training, vocational training, or apprenticeship training?
- To what extent are the postsecondary students enrolling in majors that match to in-demand occupations?
- What proportion of postsecondary graduates work in a job that is in their field of study?
- What are the various career pathways individuals follow?
- What are the education levels and employment histories of OHFA tenants? How do these vary by age group and gender?
- How do earnings vary across domographic groups? What factors may explain these differences?
- What factors predict on-time graduation from college?
- What factors predict post-graduation employment outcomes?

### Datasets
The primary datasets used in the program are all stored in the PostgreSQL database called `appliedda` on the ADRF. The primary datasets were provided by the Ohio Longitudinal Data Archive (OLDA), the Illinois Department of Empoyment Security, and the Missouri Department of Employment Security.

### Jupyter kernel
The Python3 kernel used in these notebooks was using the `requirements.txt` file.
